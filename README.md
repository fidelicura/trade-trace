# Descripton

This is CLI tool is about parsing info from your orders and getting arbitrage info of some pair.
It is simple is possible. Sorry, I meant it's much more user-friendly, that even using OS itself.

# Usage

Start the program and do what it asks. There are 3 options:

- Orders only -> just parses your orders from P2P in separate `.xlsx` file in user-friendly design;
- Arbitrage only -> prints info about arbitraging of your pair in console to serve your purposes;
- Both [Orders and Arbitrage] -> parses orders as file and after that prints your arbitrage info;
