# Descripton

This is CLI tool is about parsing info from your orders and getting arbitrage info of some pair.
It is simple is possible. Sorry, I meant it's much more user-friendly, that even using OS itself.
`poetry` and Python 3.11+ is needed.

# Usage

Start the program via `poetry shell`, then `poetry run python main.py` and do what it asks.

There are 3 options:
- Orders only -> just parses your orders from P2P in separate `.xlsx` file in user-friendly design;
- Arbitrage only -> prints info about arbitraging of your pair in console to serve your purposes;
- Both [Orders and Arbitrage] -> parses orders as file and after that prints your arbitrage info;
